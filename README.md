# DIY Publications

Storage repo for the pocket guides, cheat sheets, and zines I generate using LaTeX
and other tools. Always a work in progress. Created by me (Megan Guiney), using data
aggregated from personal experience and all over the web. Citations created as
I go. If you see anything here that you feel is based off of a work of yours,
please let me know and I will give credit where credit is due. Some of the coming
publication sources have been in my notes a long time, and have not been attributed
to a source, but i'd be glad to straighten that out, if I did, in fact, use a
publication of yours as a source.

## Contents:
  * **Regular Expressions in Python and Perl**
    * File names:
      * regex\_notation.pdf
      * regex\_cover.jpg
    * Status: In progress
    * Re: the cover: *yes* i know it looks like some edgelordy h4x0r stuff, but it was
                     designed in the tradition of old-school cutpaste publications,
                     which had usually run through a copier 10 times since initial
                     distribution by the time you got them, so... *shrug*.

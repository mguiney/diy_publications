# DIY Publications

Storage repo for the pocket guides, cheat sheets, and zines I generate using LaTeX
and other tools. Always a work in progress. Created by me (Megan Guiney), using data
aggregated from personal experience and all over the web. Citations created as
I go. If you see anything here that you feel is based off of a work of yours,
please let me know and I will give credit where credit is due. Some of the coming
publication sources have been in my notes a long time, and have not been attributed
to a source, but i'd be glad to straighten that out, if I did, in fact, use a
publication of yours as a source.

## Contents:
  * **shitty_templates:**: crude templates for documentation that i'm working on. very unpolished, will hopefully be refined over time.
  * **zines:** folded booklet.
    * regex\_notation: a primer/cheatsheet on Perl/Python regexes in the form of a folded booklet.
  * **cheatsheets:** quick references for things i've worked with/tinkered on.

## Regex Notation Zine


This is my first effort, and as such, has taken quite a while to complete. I rolled a fair bit of the formatting on this myself, and so it is somewhat clumsy.

The distinction between the two versions of the zine is a matter of print layout. If, when printing doublesided, your printer flips every other page, use the version labeled "2". If not, use version "1".

If you see any mistakes in the RegEx that I didn't end up catching, please ping me at meganguiney@gmail.com and I will fix them. LaTeX tends to eat characters, so it is entirely possible that this has occurred and I didn't notice, as I have been staring at the formatting at this on and off for literally months, and may have ended up missing the forest for the trees as a result.

The source on these is an old set of my worknotes, though some of those were taken from other sources, so if you see anything in here that you believe to have been sourced from your work, please let me know and I will cite you.

The artist who originally created the image used on the "about the author" page (which I then badly modified due to a major haircut I got since the image's initial creation) is Julia Johnson, whose other (totally adorable) art can be found on instagram @jeektri

I will probably be putting a creative commons mark on the back covers of these, but given that I don't really expect a ton of people to see these, i'll come back and do that later.`
